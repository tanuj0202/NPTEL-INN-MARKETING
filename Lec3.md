### ðŸ“˜ **Definition of Marketing** (AMA, 2017)
> *"Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."*

- The key idea: marketing is more than just selling â€” itâ€™s about delivering **value** (and *values*).
- Marketers must consider **societal impact** and **long-term value creation**, not just profits.

---

### ðŸ”¬ **Definition of Innovation**
> *"A new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from previous versions and is made available to users or implemented."*

- Innovation isn't just techâ€”it's **rethinking systems, communication, and distribution**.

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Discussion Points**
1. **Role of Innovation in the Marketing Process**:
   - Innovations should be integrated at all levels: **product creation, communication, delivery, and exchange**.
   - Example: Plastic became widespread without foresight of environmental damage. Marketers failed to plan for sustainable alternatives early.

2. **Responsibility in Marketing**:
   - Companies must **anticipate long-term impact**.
   - Marketing should balance **profit with ethics**, sustainability, and **societal well-being**.
   - Innovation should also mean doing things better **for the planet and people**, not just for sales.

3. **Examples of Missed Innovation Opportunities**:
   - Chocolates: Why not promote brushing after eating?
   - Automobiles: Why didnâ€™t car makers push responsible driving and pollution control earlier?
   - Education: Why werenâ€™t audio books, local-language materials, and toys used to reach poor or rural children earlier?

4. **Vision for the Future**:
   - Using **innovation in marketing** to reach **underserved populations** (e.g., children, rural communities) with **education, health, and nutrition**.
   - Marketers must imagine **complete value chains** that deliver **both business and social impact**.

### ðŸ§© **Suggested Exercise**

### âœ… **Key Takeaways**

- Innovation must be **forward-thinking**, **inclusive**, and **sustainable**.
- Marketing should create offerings with **value and values** for all stakeholders â€” not just customers.
